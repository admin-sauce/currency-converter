# Currency Conversion Project

This Python project allows users to convert between different currencies such as USD, CAD, EUR, INR, AUD, and CNY. The program runs in a loop, continuously accepting user input for currency conversion until the user decides to exit.

### Features
  * Accepts input for the source currency (USD, CAD, EUR, INR, AUD, CNY)
  * Converts the entered currency to the desired target currency (USD, CAD, EUR, INR, AUD, CNY).
  * The program runs in a while loop, allowing continuous currency conversion.
  * To exit the program, the user can type "q".

### Usage
  * Run the Python script.
  * Enter the source currency (USD, CAD, EUR, INR, AUD, CNY). 
  * Enter the target currency for conversion.
  * To exit the program, type "q".

### Supported Currencies
The program supports the following currencies for conversion:
<br>"USD" - United States Dollar<br>"CAD" - Canadian Dollar<br>"EUR" - Euro<br>"INR" - Indian Rupee<br>"AUD" - Australian Dollar<br>"CNY" - Chinese Yuan

### How to Run:
